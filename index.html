            <img src="img/img_hype-crowd.jpg" class="content-image" />
            <p>OzHadou Nations 13 is the latest iteration of Australia's longest running national fighting games tournament. We are very excited to bring you another three day event filled with lots of games, good times, and everlasting memories.</p>

            <p>We will kick things off on Friday from 6pm-11pm for casual gaming and exhibitions designed for players to chill out and have a good time. Players should also take this opportunity to check-in and collect their wristbands. Things get serious on Saturday and Sunday; from 10am-10pm we will be running tournament pools and the finals respectively. If you need more information, check out the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> below.</p>

            <h4 class="subheader">Getting there</h4>
            <p>We will be held in the <strong>Red Room at 99onYork (Level 1, 99 York St Sydney)</strong>. A map has been provided for your convenience below.</p>

            </div>

            <h4 class="subheader">Official tournament lineup</h4>
            <p>We'll be running tournaments for the following games.</p>

            <h4 class="subheader">DIY tournaments</h4>
            <p>Due to limited resources and staff, we are only able to cater for the most popular fighting games. In order for other games to obtain national attention and exposure, we offer space for passionate players/organisers who wish to bring their equipment and run tournaments for them.</p>

            <p>Space for DIY also has its limits. To make things fair, we will be taking applications up until <strong>mid-August</strong> and will offer space based on support from the respective communities and promptness in application.</p>

            <div data-alert class="alert-box secondary radius">You must purchase a venue entry pass to play any games at OHN and registrations for DIY tournaments will be taken by the DIY organisers on the day of the tournament.</div>

            <h4 class="subheader">Casual gaming</h4>
            <img src="img/img_casual-gaming.jpg" class="content-image" />
            <p>One of the objectives of OHN is to provide a place for fighting game enthusiasts to gather and share their passion. As such, we will be providing casual play stations throughout the weekend covering all of the games in the official tournament line-up. DIY setups will also be available for casual play outside of tournament hours.</p>

            <p>Only registered attendees that have paid the venue entry fee are permitted to play casual games in the OHN venue.</p>

                <p>All official tournaments at OHN are run in accordance with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tE4-ARncFrXfgmzLekSsnfHo_fXCsOdvoVhUFAPAjLo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">official OzHadou tournament rules</a>.

                <div data-alert class="alert-box secondary radius">These rules can change at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to make sure you are up to date with the information that is displayed here.</div>

                <p>All tournaments will be Double Elimination, played in 16 or 32 player pools (dependent on the total entrants).
